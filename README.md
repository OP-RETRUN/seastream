## Introduction to AIS

Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services (VTS) for identifying and locating vessels through the exchange of electronic data with other nearby ships, AIS base stations, and satellites. AIS aims to enhance maritime safety, navigation, and environmental protection.

### AIS Messages Overview

AIS messages are used to communicate various types of information:

- **Static Information**: Such as vessel name, dimensions, and type.
- **Voyage-Related Information**: Such as destination, ETA, and type of cargo.
- **Dynamic Information**: Such as position, course, and speed.

These messages are crucial for collision avoidance, traffic management, and maritime security.

### Encoding of AIS Messages

AIS messages are uniquely encoded to ensure efficient transmission over the VHF radio frequency. The encoding involves several steps:

#### 1. Six-Bit ASCII Armoring

- AIS uses a six-bit ASCII encoding, which is a modified version of the standard ASCII.
- Each character is represented by six bits instead of the usual eight. This allows for a more compact representation, suitable for VHF data transmission.
- The six-bit characters include a range of standard alphanumeric characters and some special characters.

#### 2. Binary Message Structure

- Each AIS message is structured as a sequence of binary fields.
- The fields represent different pieces of information, depending on the message type.
- For example, a common message type for position reports (Types 1, 2, and 3) includes fields for position coordinates, time stamp, vessel status, and more.

#### 3. Bit-Level Manipulation

- Fields within AIS messages are packed at the bit level. This means that a field can start and end at any bit within the message, not just on byte boundaries.
- This packing requires careful bit-level manipulation to parse and construct messages.

#### 4. Checksum for Integrity

- Each AIS message includes a checksum for error checking.
- The checksum is calculated using the XOR of all the characters in the sentence.

### Parsing AIS Messages

Parsing AIS messages involves:

- Decoding the six-bit ASCII characters into a binary format.
- Extracting the relevant bits for each field in the message.
- Interpreting these bits according to the specification of
